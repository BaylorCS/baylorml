 * HeapKmeans keeps k heaps, one for each cluster. The points for each cluster
 * are kept in the respective heaps, ordered by the bound difference
 * (lower-upper), where lower is the same as Hamerly's lower bound. For details
 * on this algorithm, please see the forthcoming book chapter (Partitional
 * Clustering Algorithms, Springer 2014).
 * 
 * This class adds to HeapKmeans tigher upper bound update.
