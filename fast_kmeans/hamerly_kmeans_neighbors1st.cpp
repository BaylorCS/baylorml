/* Hamerly's algorithm that is a 'simplification' of Elkan's, in that it keeps
 * the following bounds:
 *  - One upper bound per clustered record on the distance between the record
 *    and its closest center. It is always greater than or equal to the true
 *    distance between the record and its closest center. This is the same as in
 *    Elkan's algorithm.
 *  - *One* lower bound per clustered record on the distance between the record
 *    and its *second*-closest center. It is always less than or equal to the
 *    true distance between the record and its second closest center. This is
 *    different information than Elkan's algorithm -- his algorithm keeps k
 *    lower bounds for each record, for a total of (n*k) lower bounds.
 *
 * The basic ideas are:
 *  - when lower(x) <= upper(x), we need to recalculate the closest centers for
 *    the record x, and reset lower(x) and upper(x) to their boundary values
 *  - whenever a center moves
 *      - calculate the distance it moves 'd'
 *      - for each record x assigned to that center, update its upper bound
 *          - upper(x) = upper(x) + d
 *  - after each iteration
 *      - find the center that has moved the most (with distance 'd')
 *      - update the lower bound for all (?) records:
 *          - lower(x) = lower(x) - lower bound update(assignment(x))
 *
 * Parameters: none
 *
 * Return value: the number of iterations performed (always at least 1)
